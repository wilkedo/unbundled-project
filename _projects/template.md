excerpt: 'Jackie Robinson was the first African American man to intergrate Major League Baseball, but many tried before him and many came after him. He opened the door for many African American ballplayers, but the opening of this door came at both a personal and communal cost.'

## Introduction
Jackie robinson was not the first African American player to intergrate baseball. Although many credit him as our national pastime's first Black player, Moses and Weldy Walker played with the Toledo club of the American Assoication in 1884. (The American Association would go on to combine with the National Association to form what we know as Major League Baseball today.) The Walker brothers can be regarded as the 19th century's Jackie Robinson. 

After the Civil War, the nation remained deeply divided and baseball's founding father imagined the sport as a tool that not only defined the nation but one that could  reunify it. Baseball's businessmen like Albert Spalding reimagined the sport with the exclusion of players like Bud Fowler and the Walker brothers by adhereing to a "gentleman's agreement " for more than fifty years.

With this agreeement Major League owners unformally agreed to not  sign Black baseball players to their team. This agreement helped keep Black baseball players out of the Major Leagues and helped continue segregation in kind not only in baseball but in life. At the same time, it allowed players from the Spanish speaking Americas to cross the color line as labor pools for national leagues began to dwindle with talent.
