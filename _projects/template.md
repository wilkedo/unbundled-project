## Introduction
Jackie robinson was not the first African American player to intergrate baseball. All though many credit him as the national pastime's first black player, Moses and Welday Walker played with the Toledo club of the American Assoication in 1884. They can be regarded as the 19th century's Jackie Robinson. After the Civil War, the nation remained deeply divided and baseball's founding father imagined the sport as a tool to reunify the nation. However, they reimagined the sport with the exclusion of players like Moses and Weldy Walker by adhereing to the "gentleman's agreement." With this agreeement Major League owners agreed not to sign Black baseball players to their team. This agreement helped keep Black baseball players out of the Major Leagues and helped continue segregation not only in baseball but in life.
